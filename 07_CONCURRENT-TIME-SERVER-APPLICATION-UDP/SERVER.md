Certainly! I'll explain this code snippet line by line as well:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <time.h>
#define PORT 5173
```

The code starts by including necessary header files, much like the previous example.

```c
int main() {
```

The main function is defined without command-line arguments this time.

```c
    int sockfd;
    struct sockaddr_in server, client;
    char buffer[1024];
    time_t ticks;
    socklen_t len;
```

Variables are declared: `sockfd` for the socket file descriptor, `server` to hold server address information, `client` to hold client address information, `buffer` to store data being sent and received, `ticks` to store the current time, and `len` to store the length of the socket address structure.

```c
    if ((sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)) < 0) {
        perror("socket creation failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    perror("socket creation success");
```

Here, a UDP socket is created just like in the previous example. If the creation fails, an error message is printed using `perror()`, and the program exits with a failure status. Otherwise, a success message is printed.

```c
    memset(&server, 0, sizeof(server));
    memset(&client, 0, sizeof(client));
    server.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    server.sin_port = htons(PORT);
```

Server and client address structures are initialized. The server is set to listen on all available network interfaces (`INADDR_ANY`) on the specified port `PORT`.

```c
    if (bind(sockfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&server, sizeof(server)) < 0) {
        perror("bind failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
```

The `bind()` function associates the socket with the server's address. If it fails, an error message is printed, and the program exits with a failure status.

```c
    while (1) {
        len = sizeof(client);
        recvfrom(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0,
                 (struct sockaddr *)&client, &len);
        ticks = time(NULL);
        snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "%.24s\r\n", ctime(&ticks));
        sendto(sockfd, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0,
               (struct sockaddr *)&client, len);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The program enters an infinite loop to handle incoming requests. It receives data using `recvfrom()` from a client and stores it in the `buffer`. It then retrieves the current time and formats it into a string, which is stored back in the `buffer`. This formatted time string is then sent back to the client using `sendto()`. The loop continues indefinitely, serving time responses to incoming requests.

Overall, this code sets up a UDP server that listens on a specified port, receives incoming messages, responds with the current time, and continues to do so in an infinite loop.
