This C code is a simple implementation of a client program that connects to a server and sends a file over a TCP connection. Let's go through the code line by line to understand what each part does:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#define SIZE 1024
```

- This block includes necessary header files for standard input/output operations (`stdio.h`), memory allocation and conversion functions (`stdlib.h`), string manipulation functions (`string.h`), network-related functions (`arpa/inet.h` for `inet_addr`), and POSIX system calls (`unistd.h` for `close`).
- `#define SIZE 1024` creates a macro that defines the buffer size used for reading and sending data.

```c
void send_file(FILE *fp, int sockfd) {
    char data[SIZE];
    size_t n;

    while ((n = fread(data, 1, SIZE, fp)) > 0) {
        if (send(sockfd, data, n, 0) == -1) {
            perror("[-]Error in sending file.");
            exit(1);
        }
    }
}
```

- This function, `send_file`, is responsible for reading the contents of a file and sending them over the socket connection.
- It takes two arguments: a pointer to a `FILE` structure (`fp`) representing the file to be sent, and an integer `sockfd` representing the socket file descriptor.
- Within a loop, it reads chunks of data (of size `SIZE` bytes) from the file using `fread` and sends them over the socket using the `send` function.
- If there's an error in sending, it prints an error message and exits the program.

```c
int main() {
    const char *ip = "127.0.0.1";
    const int port = 8080;
    
    int sockfd;
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
    FILE *fp;
    const char *filename = "hello.txt";
```

- The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
- It defines the IP address (`ip`) and port number (`port`) to connect to.
- It declares variables for socket file descriptor (`sockfd`), a structure to hold server address information (`server_addr`), a file pointer (`fp`), and the filename to be sent (`filename`).

```c
    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd < 0) {
        perror("[-]Error in socket");
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("[+]Server socket created successfully.\n");
```

- This code block creates a socket using the `socket` function. It specifies the address family (`AF_INET` for IPv4) and socket type (`SOCK_STREAM` for a TCP socket).
- If the socket creation fails, it prints an error message and exits the program.
- If successful, it prints a message confirming the successful creation of the socket.

```c
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(port);
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(ip);
```

- Here, the server address structure `server_addr` is initialized with the IP address and port number.
- `sin_family` is set to `AF_INET` to indicate IPv4.
- `sin_port` is set using `htons` to convert the port number to network byte order.
- `sin_addr.s_addr` is set using `inet_addr` to convert the IP address to the appropriate format.

```c
    if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) == -1) {
        perror("[-]Error in socket");
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("[+]Connected to Server.\n");
```

- The `connect` function is used to establish a connection to the server using the socket descriptor, server address structure, and its size.
- If the connection fails, it prints an error message and exits the program.
- If successful, it prints a message confirming the successful connection.

```c
    fp = fopen(filename, "rb");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("[-]Error in reading file.");
        exit(1);
    }
```

- The file specified by `filename` is opened in binary read mode (`"rb"`).
- If the file opening fails (likely due to the file not being found), an error message is printed and the program exits.

```c
    send_file(fp, sockfd);
    printf("[+]File data sent successfully.\n");

    printf("[+]Closing the connection.\n");
    close(sockfd);

    return 0;
}
```

- The `send_file` function is called with the file pointer and socket descriptor, which sends the file data over the connection.
- A success message is printed once the file data is sent.
- The connection is then closed using the `close` function.
- The `main` function returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

In summary, this code establishes a TCP connection to a server, reads data from a file, sends it over the connection, and then closes the connection.
