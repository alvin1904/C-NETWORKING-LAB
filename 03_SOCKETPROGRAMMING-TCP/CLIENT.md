Sure, I'll explain the second code snippet, which is a client-side implementation for a simple client-server communication using sockets in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <unistd.h> // read(), write(), close()
#include <strings.h> // bzero()
#include <arpa/inet.h> // inet_addr()
#define MAX 80
#define PORT 8080
#define SA struct sockaddr
```
These are the header files included for various functions and data types required for socket communication and basic operations. `MAX` is defined as the maximum buffer size for messages, and `PORT` is the port number on which the client will connect to the server. `SA` is again used as a shorthand for `struct sockaddr`.

```c
void func(int sockfd)
{
    char buff[MAX];
    int n;
    for (;;)
    {
        bzero(buff, sizeof(buff));
        printf("Enter the string : ");
        n = 0;
        while ((buff[n++] = getchar()) != '\n')
            ;
        write(sockfd, buff, sizeof(buff));
        bzero(buff, sizeof(buff));
        read(sockfd, buff, sizeof(buff));
        printf("From Server : %s", buff);
        if ((strncmp(buff, "exit", 4)) == 0)
        {
            printf("Client Exit...\n");
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
This function, `func`, is responsible for handling the communication between the client and the server. It first clears the `buff` array using `bzero`. It then reads input from the user using `getchar` until they press Enter, storing the input in the `buff` array. The client sends this message to the server using the `write` function.

Then, it clears the `buff` array again and reads the server's response using the `read` function. The server's response is then printed. If the received message is "exit," the client terminates the communication loop.

```c
int main()
{
    int sockfd, connfd;
    struct sockaddr_in servaddr, cli;

    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd == -1)
    {
        printf("socket creation failed...\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    else
        printf("Socket successfully created..\n");
    bzero(&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr));

    servaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    servaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
    servaddr.sin_port = htons(PORT);

    if (connect(sockfd, (SA *)&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr)) != 0)
    {
        printf("connection with the server failed...\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    else
        printf("connected to the server..\n");

    func(sockfd);

    close(sockfd);
}
```
This is the main function of the client. It creates a socket using the `socket` function, specifying the address family and socket type. If socket creation fails, an error message is printed, and the program exits. If successful, a success message is printed.

It initializes the `servaddr` structure with the server's IP address (`"127.0.0.1"` represents localhost) and port number. It then uses the `connect` function to establish a connection with the server using the provided server address. If the connection fails, an error message is printed, and the program exits. If successful, a success message is printed.

The `func` function is called to handle the communication with the server. Once the communication is finished, the client closes the socket using the `close` function and terminates.

In summary, this client-side code establishes a connection to a server, allows the user to send messages to the server, receives and prints the server's responses, and exits when the user inputs "exit".
